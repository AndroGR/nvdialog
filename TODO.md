# Features to implement in the future versions:
- [ ] Notification support (Targeted for 0.5.0)
- [ ] Instead of linking at compile time, link libraries at runtime using `dlopen` instead. (Targeted for 0.5.0)
- [ ] Replace Gtk3 backend with a Qt one for KDE. (Cancelled due to licensing issues)
- [x] Setup CI (Done)
- [ ] Switch to meson as the build system (This is questionable and will not happen anytime soon. Relax for now).
