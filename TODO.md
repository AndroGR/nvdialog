###### *Note: Since v0.2 isn't released yet, everything in this list may change.*
# Features to implement in the future versions:
- [ ] Notification support
- [ ] Instead of linking at compile time, link libraries at runtime using `dlopen` instead.
- [ ] Replace Gtk3 backend with a Qt one for KDE.
- [ ] Setup CI
- [ ] Switch to meson as the build system (This is questionable and will not happen anytime soon. Relax for now).
- [ ] Use environment variables to hint a backend.
